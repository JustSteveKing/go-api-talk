# Go API Talk

This repository contains the talk for my talk on "REST APIs with GCP and GitHub Actions"

To get started with this, simply clone the project.

You can run this locally using:

```bash
$ go mod download
$ go run cmd/server.go
```

Or if you are using docker:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d --build
```

The github actions have yet to be connected to a google account, but will fill in more details below once they have been finished. Currently they are in place, and will work - but I need to add a few instructions.
